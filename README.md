# Cohort Connect

Need to get a team together on linkedin, but all you have is a list of email addresses? No problem. Just feed the emails into cohort connect and each person will receive an email to join your group. When they sign up, they will appear on your groups main page.

Now all members can easily see who they should connect with.

Great for bootcamp cohorts where people forget to add their classmates because they assume they're already all connected.
